A [recent article in the times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/well/eat/counting-calories-weight-loss-diet-dieting-low-carb-low-fat.html) cited a study by JAMA that stated that cutting out sugar is the key to weight loss.

>It found that people who cut back on added sugar, refined grains and highly processed foods while concentrating on eating plenty of vegetables and whole foods — without worrying about counting calories or limiting portion sizes — lost significant amounts of weight over the course of a year.

I thought most people knew this already? Sugar = bad, vegetables = good. 

Obviously following a diet low in sugar and refined carbohydrates but high in vegetables is easier said than done. Just surprised the NIH spent $8 million dollars to figure that out.
