&ndash; I ended up tearing my meniscus nearly in half. 

What's the meniscus?
The meniscus are two crescent shaped rubber like pieces of tissues that sit in the middle of your knee joint. They act as stabilizers and shock absorbers for your knees, they're the only thing that keeps your femur and tibia bones from grinding against each other. Everytime you walk, run, jump, or squat, your body is putting weight and pressure on your meniscus. Without them, all the pressure would be absorbed by the bones of your legs -- you'd end up with accelerated arthritis, which inevitably leads to an artificial knee replacement (robo knees).

So, why would I have gladly traded the aforementioned injuries for a torn meniscus?
The main reason is there's no way to predict if meniscus tears will ever heal. Unlike broken bones and torn ligaments, the meniscus are in a location that receives very little blood supply. Like cuts on your skin, cracks on your bone, tears in your muscles...blood is what provides the cells the energy to repair themselves. The space in between your knee joints have almost none. 

Right now, there are 3 treatments for a torn meniscus; Physical therapy, meniscectomy, or a repair.

Depending on the type of tear you have and the kind of lifestyle you live (and want to live in the future) will determine the treatment selection.

If your tear is minor and isn't impeding your movement too much, physical therapy is the recommended route. If your tear is impeding your movement, your surgeon will determine whether to repair the tear or trim the tear out.
