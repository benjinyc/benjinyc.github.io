## “They’re just smaller, lighter, and pink” ## 

^ Probably was true a decade ago. This is not the case today. Having said that, you are not going to find a lot of resources online (snowboard manufacturers, online resalers, etc) explaining the differences.

When choosing a snowboard shape, the three most popular criteria that get asked in order of importance are; Riding style, rider's weight, and rider's shoe size? Without going into detail (just look it up online), there is one thing manufacturers seem to leave out when marketing women's snowboards, center of gravity.



- Riding Style: Beginer, freestyler, only rides powder? These determine the shape, binding insert location, and curvature of the snowboard.
